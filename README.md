# Predicting Electricity Consumption using Time Series Analysis


Welcome to the repository for the project "Predicting Electricity Consumption using Time Series Analysis" by the Department of Statistics at Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune.

## ⏲️ What is Time Series Analysis?

Time series analysis is a technique for predicting events through a sequence of time. It is used in various fields such as geology, behavior, and economics. This technique predicts future events by analyzing past trends, assuming that future trends will follow historical patterns.

Time series analysis is applied in numerous areas, including:

- Weather forecasting
- Earthquake prediction
- Astronomy
- Statistics
- Mathematical finance
- Econometrics
- Pattern recognition
- Signal processing
- Control engineering

Modern time series forecasting often involves computer technologies like:

- Machine learning
- Artificial neural networks
- Support vector machines
- Fuzzy logic
- Gaussian processes
- Hidden Markov models

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to predict electricity consumption using time series analysis techniques. We'll explore patterns, trends, and seasonality in the electricity consumption data from 1985 to 2018. The ultimate goal is to build a forecasting model that predicts electricity consumption for the next 6 years, up to 2024.

## 📊 Project Stages

The time series forecasting process involves several stages:

1. **Visualizing Time Series:** Explore the data visually to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality.

2. **Stationarizing Time Series:** Transform the series into a stationary one, where statistical properties are constant over time.

3. **Finding Best Model Parameters:** Determine optimal model parameters from ACF (AutoCorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial AutoCorrelation Function) plots.

4. **Fitting Model:** Fit an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to the stationary data.

5. **Predictions:** Use the model to predict electricity consumption for the next 6 years.

## 📈 Problem Statement

The dataset contains two columns: Date and Consumption Percentage. It represents electricity consumption from 1985 to 2018. The goal is to predict electricity consumption for the next 6 years, until 2024.

## 📚 Project Structure

- **Code:** Contains the Python code for implementing time series analysis and forecasting.
- **Data:** Houses the dataset used for the analysis.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing each stage of the time series analysis.
- **Results:** Stores visualizations and predictions generated during the analysis.
